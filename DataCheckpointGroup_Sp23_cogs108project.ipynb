    "How does people’s health consciousness affect the healthy degree of their weight in the U.S. in 2017? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Health consciousness is defined as the degree to which people value their health. In this context, one's subjective behaviors to make them healthy are considered more health-conscious (for example, having health insurance and doing exercise regularly). Conversely, actions that are detrimental to health imply a lack of health consciousness (for example, smoking or drinking).The way we quantize will be discussed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The healthy degree of one's weight is defined based on the standard BMI scale, and it indicates how healthy one’s weight is. For the BMI standard, the healthy range is [18.5, 25). With a BMI out of this range, one is considered to be underweight or overweight, which is less healthy. If one’s BMI is larger than 30, we will consider one obese, which is morbid and should be treated as a disease. We will talk more about how we use BMI to measure this variable in the following parts.  \n",

    "Having more health awareness causes an increase in people’s health of weight (concepts defined above).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have this expectation because keeping healty body weight is an important part of personal health, and it seems that people who maintain health intentionally usually have healthier body weight. We want to test if there's a cause-and-effect relationship. \n",
